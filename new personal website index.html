	My name is Nur Ardina Insyirrah Binti Abd Aziz, i was born on 11th August 2003 at Hospital Sutanah Aminah, Johor Bharu.
	I am a senior in high school. Everyone can agree that I am a good student and that I like to study. My favorite subjects are science. 
	I am going to enter the university because my goal is to study these subjects in future and to become a respected professional in one of the fields.
	I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and ready to help. The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. 
	I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.
	The goal I’m currently striving for is to make this world a better place to live in by starting the changes with myself. Sure, I’ve had bad experiences in my life too, but this is exactly what made me the way I am now: grateful, 
	full of love, with a desire to study well because it will help me become a successful person in future and have a high quality of life. I believe that it is manifesting day by day and I feel even more responsibility for what I do and where I go. With all I already have, I know that I’m on the right path and I will do my best to inspire others to live the way they feel like living as well.

	Education has always been a major priority for me. I was brought up in a family that was centered on education. Both of my grandma’s were teachers. I have sixteen aunts and uncles and all but 3 of them have college degrees. Ten of those a master’s degree, and 4 of them went on to earn their PhD. 
	My parents are both college graduates. Ever since I’ve been old enough to really understand things, they have stressed how important it is to be educated. 
	There have been far more good ones than bad ones. These teachers have a major impact on the students that they teach day in and day out. Each teacher and professor has his or her own teaching style.  What works for one does not necessarily work for the other. On the other hand, each teaching style does not always work well with some individual students. It is the teacher who can adapt to these circumstances students who can really have a profound effect on their students. I had one the best professors I have ever met. His name was Dr. Hammond.  He was a professor in the Political Science department.  
	Dr. Hammond used many nontraditional teaching methods, but that was what made him so great.
	So growing up I found education to be a vitally important part of my life.  My primary school is at SMK GEMEREH.My secondary school are at SMK SERI KENANGAN which is i take science as my favourite subject.
	I am currently study at UiTM Merbok, Kedah. I love study here which i get the experience to explore the other country since i live in Johor

	The family is a valuable god gift which plays a most crucial role in every individual’s life. I love my family very much because all of my family members stand in my good as well as bad times. From moral teachings to love and support, my family has always helped me without any demand. 
	There is no doubt that we experience our biggest triumphs when we really connect to them.
	I have no siblings. My father and mother are at the same age which is 41 this year and have the same works.I love to see them happy
	I love my mom's cooking. she always cook my favorite dish which is Asam Pedas. I love her cooking iternally.
